PSA: where multiple values have to be added, they are in the following order:
telemetry/transition/command/batch/reply
x,y : there are x regionals with y locals
regionals_with_tot_locals         = 4,3
In x_type_and_additional_info need to put type, delay_lower_router for x node
central_type_and_additional_info  = Type0,0.3,Type0
regional_type_and_additional_info = Type0,0.3,0.5
local_type_and_additional_info    = Type0,0.2,0.6
Central is the exception, having type, delay_lower, type of storage
delay_wan                         = 0.5
actuator_type                     = Type0
number_of_sensor_type             = 2
number_of_lan_types               = 2
weight_actuators                  = 1
